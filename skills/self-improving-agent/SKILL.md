# Self-Improvement Skill

Log learnings and errors to markdown files for continuous improvement. Coding agents can later process these into fixes, and important learnings get promoted to project memory.

## Quick Reference

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Command/operation fails | Log to `.learnings/ERRORS.md` |
| User corrects you | Log to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` with category `correction` |
| User wants missing feature | Log to `.learnings/FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` |
| API/external tool fails | Log to `.learnings/ERRORS.md` with integration details |
| Knowledge was outdated | Log to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` with category `knowledge_gap` |
| Found better approach | Log to `.learnings/LEARNINGS.md` with category `best_practice` |
| Similar to existing entry | Link with `**See Also**`, consider priority bump |
| Broadly applicable learning | Promote to `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and/or `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Workflow improvements | Promote to `AGENTS.md` (OpenClaw workspace) |
| Tool gotchas | Promote to `TOOLS.md` (OpenClaw workspace) |
| Behavioral patterns | Promote to `SOUL.md` (OpenClaw workspace) |

## OpenClaw Setup (Recommended)

OpenClaw is the primary platform for this skill. It uses workspace-based prompt injection with automatic skill loading.

### Installation

**Via ClawdHub (recommended):**
```bash
clawdhub install self-improving-agent
```

**Manual:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/peterskoett/self-improving-agent.git ~/.openclaw/skills/self-improving-agent
```

### Workspace Structure

OpenClaw injects these files into every session:

```
~/.openclaw/workspace/
├── AGENTS.md          # Multi-agent workflows, delegation patterns
├── SOUL.md            # Behavioral guidelines, personality, principles
├── TOOLS.md           # Tool capabilities, integration gotchas
├── MEMORY.md          # Long-term memory (main session only)
├── memory/            # Daily memory files
│   └── YYYY-MM-DD.md
└── .learnings/        # This skill's log files
    ├── LEARNINGS.md
    ├── ERRORS.md
    └── FEATURE_REQUESTS.md
```

### Create Learning Files

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.openclaw/workspace/.learnings
```

Then create the log files (or copy from `assets/`):
- `LEARNINGS.md` — corrections, knowledge gaps, best practices
- `ERRORS.md` — command failures, exceptions
- `FEATURE_REQUESTS.md` — user-requested capabilities

### Promotion Targets

When learnings prove broadly applicable, promote them to workspace files:

| Learning Type | Promote To | Example |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Behavioral patterns | `SOUL.md` | "Be concise, avoid disclaimers" |
| Workflow improvements | `AGENTS.md` | "Spawn sub-agents for long tasks" |
| Tool gotchas | `TOOLS.md` | "Git push needs auth configured first" |

### Inter-Session Communication

OpenClaw provides tools to share learnings across sessions:

- **sessions_list** — View active/recent sessions
- **sessions_history** — Read another session's transcript
- **sessions_send** — Send a learning to another session
- **sessions_spawn** — Spawn a sub-agent for background work

### Optional: Enable Hook

For automatic reminders at session start:

```bash
# Copy hook to OpenClaw hooks directory
cp -r hooks/openclaw ~/.openclaw/hooks/self-improvement

# Enable it
openclaw hooks enable self-improvement
```

See `references/openclaw-integration.md` for complete details.

## Generic Setup (Other Agents)

For Claude Code, Codex, Copilot, or other agents, create `.learnings/` in your project:

```bash
mkdir -p .learnings
```

Copy templates from `assets/` or create files with headers.

## Templates, Formats & Extended Reference

See [references/templates.md](references/templates.md) for templates and detailed examples.

Covers: logging format (learning/error/feature entries), ID generation, resolving entries, promoting to project memory, recurring pattern detection, periodic review, detection triggers, priority guidelines, area tags, best practices, gitignore options, hook integration, automatic skill extraction, and multi-agent support.
