# OpenClaw Memory Plan — Step Inventory

The master list of all atomic steps for the memory infrastructure upgrade. Each row is one step
that runs through the 9-phase Framework cycle and produces exactly one commit at Phase 9.

**Status legend.** `[ ]` queued · `[A]` in-flight · `[x]` closed

**Versioning.** `v<block>.<step>`. Initial state is `v0.0` (no steps closed).
Each step bumps through `vX.Y-pre`, `vX.Y-mid`, then clean `vX.Y` at commit.

**Source.** Steps below are derived from [REFERENCE_PLAN.md](REFERENCE_PLAN.md).

## Block 0 — Stop the bleeding

Fix active bugs in the existing harness before adding complexity. See REFERENCE_PLAN.md §Phase 0.

| Block | Step | Version | Status | Description |
|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | 0.1 | v0.1 | [x] | Wire MemoryBudget.reload() into daemon flush paths + NATS subscription + test |

> **Step 0.1 closed.** `reload()` now fires after both daemon flush paths (pre-compression and end-of-session) and via an optional NATS subscription on `mesh.memory.compaction_completed`. One new test added. 6 positive audit findings, zero corrections.
| 0 | 0.2 | v0.2 | [x] | Resolve .companion-state.md collision (rename to .daemon-state-${NODE_ID}.md + migrate readers) |

> **Step 0.2 closed.** Daemon state file renamed from `.companion-state.md` to `.daemon-state-${NODE_ID}.md` across all four readers (daemon, session-start hook, daily-log-writer, mission-control tasks route). Migration script added at `scripts/migrate-companion-state.mjs`. Function `readCompanionState` renamed to `readDaemonState`. 6 positive audit findings, zero corrections, zero Phase 8 patches.
| 0 | 0.3 | v0.3 | [x] | Fix mergeFacts parenthetical chain (supersedes-event-id comment model + one-time cleanup) |

> **Step 0.3 closed.** Replaced parenthetical merge format `(updated: ...)` with supersedes-comment model `<!-- supersedes: <hash> -->` in `mergeFacts`. Added `cleanParentheticalChains` for legacy cleanup and `stripSupersedes` for clean similarity comparison. 5 new regression tests. 6 positive audit findings, zero corrections, zero Phase 8 patches.
| 0 | 0.4 | v0.4 | [x] | Include assistant-role messages in extraction + add speaker field + new patterns |

> **Step 0.4 closed.** Opened `extractFacts` role filter to include assistant messages alongside user messages. Added `stripSpeaker` helper and two assistant-voice pattern groups (`agent_action`, `finding`). Added `speaker` field on extracted facts. Updated `mergeFacts` to format MEMORY.md entries with `[user]`/`[assistant]` prefix and strip speaker tags during similarity comparison. 5 new tests. 6 positive audit findings, zero corrections, zero Phase 8 patches.
| 0 | 0.5 | v0.5 | [ ] | Fix mid-word truncation via truncateAtWord helper |
| 0 | 0.6 | v0.6 | [ ] | Delete dead artifacts (.pre-compact-state.md write, .tmp/session-fingerprint.json, .tmp/frontend-activity, confidence field) |
| 0 | 0.7 | v0.7 | [ ] | Document state files (docs/STATE_FILES.md) |

## Block 1 — Schema & event foundations

|-------|------|---------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 1.1 | v1.1 | [ ] | Create packages/event-schemas (zod envelope + memory event payloads + discriminated union) |
| 1 | 1.2 | v1.2 | [ ] | Create local event log substrate (lib/local-event-log.mjs + JetStream R=1 stream + dual-write wiring) |
| 1 | 1.3 | v1.3 | [ ] | Create content-addressed artifact store (lib/artifacts.mjs + ~/.openclaw/artifacts/) |

## Block 2 — Local semantic layer

Major gate. Add semantic retrieval; validate against real queries (Gulf 1 close).
See REFERENCE_PLAN.md §Phase 2. **NOTE:** scope must be revisited before starting — `lib/mcp-knowledge/`
already implements sqlite-vec + embeddings against the workspace. Step 2.1 begins with a scope review
gate per RESUME.md §0.

| 2 | 2.3 | v2.3 | [ ] | Chunk and embed existing sessions (resumable migration with checkpoint file) |
| 2 | 2.4 | v2.4 | [ ] | Implement semanticSearch + hybridSearch (RRF) + CLI --semantic/--hybrid flags |

| 3 | 3.3 | v3.3 | [ ] | Wire LLM extraction into daemon + new entity/theme/decision/mention tables in SQLite |
