## 2026-05-28 — Step 0.3 closed: local NATS (JetStream, loopback) running as launchd service

A single-node `nats-server` (homebrew v2.12.6) now runs under launchd (`ai.openclaw.nats`), bound to `127.0.0.1:4222` (monitor `:8222`), JetStream enabled (store `~/.openclaw/nats/jetstream/`, caps 128MB mem / 1GB file). Self-healing (KeepAlive) and verified to survive `kickstart -k` (PID 58563 → 58591). This is the local event-log substrate (D3) the watcher (L2) will read.

**Finding — "you already have NATS" was the remote mesh, not a local server.** `~/.openclaw/openclaw.env` sets `OPENCLAW_NATS=nats://100.91.131.61:4222` (Ubuntu worker's Tailscale IP, currently down) — that's why the daemon logged `NATS unavailable (TIMEOUT)`. The resolver chain ([lib/nats-resolve.js](redesign/../../lib/nats-resolve.js)) is env var → `openclaw.env` → `~/openclaw/.mesh-config` → `127.0.0.1:4222` fallback, so the remote IP wins. That remote mesh is the federation layer D4 keeps dormant — NOT the local piece 0.3 needs.

**Decision — install local NATS (operator chose "follow the plan" over reusing the remote mesh).** *Why:* the whole redesign is local-first; the event log is meant to be a local substrate; D4 explicitly defers federation until the local core is solid; and reusing the remote depends on a remote box staying up. The local node is loopback-only (no off-box exposure, no auth needed for 127.0.0.1) and is a separate interface from the remote — no conflict.

**Decision — single loopback node, NOT the repo `services/nats/` 3-node cluster.** Those cluster plists are the G-phase / step 10.2 deliverable (R=3 federation). For L0, a single node is correct (MEMORY_REDESIGN L0: "single-node for local; the 3-node cluster is a G-phase concern").

**Decision — 0.4 will point the daemon at local via its launchd `OPENCLAW_NATS` env var, NOT by editing `openclaw.env`.** The env var is resolution step 1 (highest priority); the resolver's own comment names launchd as the intended override. This keeps mission-control + all `mesh-*` scripts pointed where they are (at the remote mesh config) while the memory daemon uses the local node — clean separation, no collateral.

*Consequences:* (1) COMPONENT_REGISTRY 7.1 → LOCAL NODE RUNNING (streams not yet created). (2) `openclaw.env` and the `mesh-*` launchd jobs left untouched (D4 dormant). (3) Disk is at 94% (12 GiB free) → JetStream file store capped at 1GB; revisit if the event log grows. (4) Rollback: `launchctl bootout gui/501/ai.openclaw.nats` + `rm` the plist. (5) Next: 0.4 — daemon ↔ local NATS, create the `local-events-<nodeId>` stream, confirm a test publish lands.

## 2026-05-28 — Step 0.2 closed: daemon binary symlinked + restarted; code half of deploy gap CLOSED

Runtime `~/.openclaw/workspace/bin/memory-daemon.mjs` is now a symlink → repo `workspace-bin/memory-daemon.mjs`, and the daemon was restarted onto it (launchd kickstart). **First time new-bin + new-lib ran together** — and they run clean. New PID 51216 (≠ old 869), executing the symlinked repo file, stable 2:48+ past the 10s ThrottleInterval, `:7893` → 401. The code half of the deploy gap is closed: the running daemon IS repo HEAD. Only NATS remains (0.3/0.4).

**Done-evidence refinement (the planned substitution, now confirmed necessary).** INVENTORY 0.2 done-evidence said "after restart a log line only current code emits appears." Verified impossible at 0.2: old/new startup banners are byte-identical, and *every* new-only log line is gated behind a successful NATS connection ("Shared stream OPENCLAW_SHARED verified" etc.), which won't happen until NATS is up (0.4). Substituted per MASTER_PLAN §5 — "a process state visible in ps/launchctl that only the new code creates": the symlink target + new PID executing the repo file + crash-loop-free stability. The NATS-gated lines become deferred confirming evidence at 0.4.

**Restart-instant native crash investigated, ruled benign.** Two lines hit `.err` at the exact restart instant (mtime 16:34:10): `libc++abi: … mutex lock failed: Invalid argument` (count 1) and `[memory-daemon] PID check failed (process not alive): kill ESRCH`. Both belong to the **old** process (869) being torn down: its better-sqlite3 native binding hit a mutex while SIGTERM killed it mid-operation; the watchdog then saw 869 gone. *Proof they're not the new code:* after these lines, new PID 51216 ran 2:48+ adding zero further `.err` lines with the inject server responding — the `.err` size/mtime are frozen at the restart instant. Not a regression; a one-time shutdown artifact of the dying old process.

*Consequences:* (1) COMPONENT_REGISTRY Family 8 → CODE CLOSED (both `lib/` and binary are live symlinks; remaining gap is NATS only, not code). (2) Rollback binary `bin/memory-daemon.mjs.bak-2026-05-23` retained; full data security copy at `~/.openclaw/backups/pre-step-0.2-2026-05-28/`. (3) Pre-existing Zod extraction-validation errors (`Invalid option: expected one of "depends_on"|…`) persist as the known baseline — unrelated to the deploy gap, a separate extraction-schema issue to triage (OUT_OF_SCOPE candidate). (4) Next: 0.3 install local NATS (JetStream) as a launchd service.

## 2026-05-28 — Step 0.1 closed: lib/ deploy gap closed via symlink; mcp-knowledge deps = "move the box"

First executable redesign step. Runtime `~/.openclaw/workspace/lib` is now a symlink → repo `lib/`. The `lib/` deploy gap is permanently closed (repo IS runtime for libraries; drift cannot reopen).

**Sub-decision — mcp-knowledge native deps: Option A (move the box).** The daemon's inject server dynamically imports `lib/mcp-knowledge/core.mjs`, which needs 580 MB of compiled native deps (better-sqlite3 + BGE-M3 stack) that existed ONLY in the runtime copy. A naive symlink would have yanked them and broken retrieval. Chosen: move the existing, already-working node_modules into repo `lib/mcp-knowledge/node_modules` (same-FS instant rename; already gitignored) BEFORE flipping the symlink. *Why over the alternatives:* reuses deps proven to load under the daemon's exact node (zero ABI/rebuild risk vs. a fresh `npm install`); keeps a clean single source vs. symlinking node_modules back into the retired runtime dir.

**No restart in 0.1** (by design — restart is 0.2). The running daemon (PID 869) keeps its in-memory modules; the swap doesn't disturb it. "Still boots" verified as: daemon alive + :7893 up + better-sqlite3 loads/runs through the symlink under `~/.openclaw/bin/node`.

*Consequences:* (1) daemon binary still drifted until 0.2 — first new-bin+new-lib run happens at 0.2 restart; watch boot log for missing-import/signature errors against the 11 repo-only lib files. (2) Rollback snapshot `~/.openclaw/workspace/lib.bak-2026-05-28` retained until 0.2 confirms a clean restart. (3) COMPONENT_REGISTRY Family 8 now PARTIALLY CLOSED.

## 2026-05-28 — Session boundary (handoff)

This session built the entire discipline + planning + tooling layer; **no memory-pipeline code was changed.** Committed work (git log): audit (AUDIT_2026-05-27) → discipline bootstrap (MASTER_PLAN, scope-check hook, COMPONENT_REGISTRY, CLAUDE.md) → DESIGN_INPUTS → redesign roadmap (MEMORY_REDESIGN) + 40-step atomic INVENTORY + 9-phase WORKFLOW + Re-Orient Loop → viewer Master Plan tab → redesign-tick automation (built, not loaded) → viewer transition notifications (top-right NC banner via terminal-notifier, Glass/Sosumi, names the step + time, mute toggle).

**Next action: redesign step 0.1** (deploy gap: symlink runtime→repo, start NATS), run **interactively**. No active scope — a fresh session sets one per redesign/WORKFLOW.md §6. Passation protocol is in CLAUDE.md (the auto-loaded entry point) + this ledger.

## 2026-05-28 — Memory redesign: 6 foundational decisions (local-first)

Operator answered the six DESIGN_INPUTS §7 open questions. Locked:

**D1 — Keep all 5 stores. Collapse nothing.** state.db (episodic), knowledge.db (semantic vec), extraction tables (entity), graph-cache.db (thematic index), + the event log. Plus the Obsidian vault as the wiki layer. *Why:* nothing already built gets thrown away. *Consequence:* the redesign is additive/repair, not a teardown. The "one-hop simplicity" bar from DESIGN_INPUTS §2 applies to NEW work, not to deleting existing stores.

**D2 — Synthesis runs on session-end AND every 30 min while a session is active.** The "turn raw → readable wiki" step has two triggers. *Why:* end-of-session captures the whole arc; the 30-min active cadence keeps long sessions fresh. *Consequence:* the consolidation/synthesis scheduler needs both an event hook (session-end) and an interval (30 min, gated on active session).

**D3 — Add the event log now; erase nothing; local-first then multi-node.** The per-node event log gets wired as part of local work. *Why:* it's the substrate the memory-watcher (D6) consumes and the future federation promoter needs. *Consequence:* event-sourcing comes back INTO scope (it was a DESIGN_INPUTS §7 tension) — accepted deliberately because the watcher needs it. Local correctness first; multi-node is a later phase. Nothing already implemented is removed.

**D4 — Federation stays, dormant/offline, until local is solid.** *Why:* it exists and works in code; turning it on now adds NATS-cluster/trust complexity before the local core is even running. *Consequence:* federation modules stay in the tree (not deleted), not launched. "Local running proper" is the gate before "going global." Nothing erased.

**D5 — Readable output = the already-documented synthesis layer; make it actually run.** Not a new design. The docs already specify: structured MEMORY.md (generated from entity/theme/decision tables — REFERENCE_PLAN Phase 3.3) + the Obsidian vault (concepts/decisions/sessions/themes notes — Phase 5) regenerated by consolidation (Phase 8). This IS the Karpathy LLM-Wiki layer-2. *Why:* the design exists; the failure is that it never executes (consolidation undeployed, vault not generating). *Consequence:* the redesign's job for #5 is to wire + run the documented synthesis, replacing the lossy daily logs (OUT_OF_SCOPE 2026-05-27) with the structured MEMORY.md + vault wiki.

**D6 — Build a memory-watcher: full observability/logging/debug device over the ENTIRE memory system.** Watches everything — who/where/how/when of every memory operation (ingest, extract, synthesize, retrieve, inject, decay, promote). Clear structured logging. Purpose: control, log, and debug what's actually happening, to eliminate silent failures and nonsense code. *Why:* the current system's #1 failure mode is silent inertness (operations that no-op without surfacing). *Consequence:* the watcher is built EARLY (right after the event log), as the verification lens for all other redesign work. It consumes the D3 event log + instruments operations directly.

These six are the foundation of MEMORY_REDESIGN.md. Local-first ordering, federation deferred, nothing deleted.

**Sub-decision (same session):** the memory-watcher's readable surface (D6) lives as a **panel in mission-control** (the existing ops UI, PID 872), not in the workplan-viewer and not standalone. Phase order L0→G accepted as proposed (operator expressed no preference → proceed with recommended order).

## 2026-05-28 — Atomicity revision + the Re-Orient Loop

Operator asked to (a) re-decompose steps to their most atomic level, and (b) hook a "global-view loop" into the 9-phase framework to counter the attention-span deficit when digging deep.

**Atomicity revision:** redesign INVENTORY re-decomposed 33 → 40 steps (36 local + 4 deferred). Rule applied: one step = one independently-verifiable runtime outcome. Notable splits — Block 0 deploy/NATS into 4; Block 2 watcher core vs classification, API vs UI; Block 4 (synthesis, the heart) into 9 (concept vs session notes, two triggers separated, consolidation deploy vs schedule, digest-build vs retire-old); Block 6 route vs migrate. **Ordering fix:** event-log emission for each operation is folded into the step that *builds* that operation (synthesize/decay/promote events now live in Block 4 build-steps), not front-loaded in Block 1 — Block 1 only wires events for ops that already exist (ingest/extract/inject/error).

**The Re-Orient Loop (WORKFLOW §7):** two mandatory cadences embedded in the per-step lifecycle. *Why:* deep implementation work makes the global picture fade → drift; willpower doesn't fix it, structure does.
- **Micro (every step):** Phase 1 AUDIT_PRE opens with a ≤6-line `§0 Re-orient` (where am I / last change / this step's contribution / north-star link / still-right-next?). Forces a look-up before every dig.
- **Macro (every block close):** a Global Review — re-read MASTER_PLAN+DESIGN_INPUTS, update COMPONENT_REGISTRY via runtime probes, re-atomicity-check the next block, drift check, log course-corrections. Re-establishes the whole picture ≥1×/block.
- **Tripwire:** Phase-4 sprawl or ≥2 mid-implementation findings = the step wasn't atomic → stop, re-orient, split.
*Consequence:* "the deeper you dig, the more often you must surface" is now a framework rule, not a hope. The viewer's Master Plan tab is the re-orient surface.

## 2026-05-28 — Redesign-tick automation: built, BLOCK-not-fake, NOT auto-loaded

Operator chose "build redesign-tick wiring first" (over running L0 interactively now). Built the autonomous tick for the redesign plan: `workspace-bin/redesign-tick.sh` + `memory-plan/redesign/TICK_PROMPT.md` + `services/launchd/com.openclaw.redesign-tick.plist`, plus fixed `redesign/automation.json` paths.

**Safety design (resolves the standing concern that a headless tick re-creates the original "59 closed, 0 working" disaster):** the TICK_PROMPT's overriding rule is **done = runtime-observable; if you cannot produce the step's runtime evidence, BLOCK — do not fake-close.** The commit format requires a `Runtime-Evidence:` trailer citing an observed runtime proof; no trailer → no commit → BLOCK. A Phase-4 sprawl tripwire forces a BLOCK-and-split when a step turns out non-atomic. So the tick can safely *attempt* steps: it self-pauses (BLOCKED.md) on anything it can't verify, surfacing it for the operator.

**NOT auto-loaded.** The plist is installed in `~/Library/LaunchAgents` but deliberately not bootstrapped (`launchctl list` shows nothing). `RunAtLoad=false`. Enabling autonomous ticks — and *for which steps* — remains a separate operator decision. Recommendation still stands (DESIGN_INPUTS / prior analysis): run the foundation phases L0–L2 interactively (runtime-heavy, need a live environment + operator judgment); reconsider the tick for mechanical/test-verifiable steps only after the watcher (L2) provides observability.

*Consequence:* the automation exists and is verifiable (`redesign-tick.sh --preflight` reports next step without invoking claude) but inert until explicitly enabled. The viewer's Automation tab can load it when the operator decides.

## 2026-05-28 — Viewer emits banner+sound on plan state transitions

The workplan-viewer now fires the existing `memory-plan-notify.sh` server-side on plan transitions (a 12s poller diffs each plan's {version, blocked, closed_steps}):
- **Forward** (step closed / version advanced) → `closed` → **Glass** chime + banner.
- **Blocked** (a plan's BLOCKED.md appears) → `blocked` → **Sosumi** alert + banner.

*Why server-side:* it fires whether or not a browser tab is open — the right behavior for an operator monitoring autonomous ticks. *Why reuse notify.sh:* one source of truth for sounds/banners shared with the tick wrapper. First-sight of a plan seeds silently (no startup storm); `MEMORY_PLAN_NOTIFY=off` disables. A `/api/notify-test?kind=forward|block` endpoint verifies the wiring. Verified: both test kinds fire (enabled:true); a real induced block transition (touch redesign/BLOCKED.md) produced `[notify] redesign BLOCKED at v0.0` and the banner, then cleared.

**Amended 2026-05-28 (operator: "leave the banner until I discard it" → "both persist"):** transient `display notification` banners auto-dismiss and their persistence is only a per-app System-Settings toggle (not script-controllable). So `memory-plan-notify.sh` now renders a **detached `display alert` WINDOW** that stays until the operator clicks Dismiss — for BOTH forward (Glass) and block (Sosumi, `as critical`) — with no `giving up after`. Launched `nohup … &` so the caller returns immediately and the window survives independently; the afplay chime still plays. Trade-off accepted: a focus-grabbing window pops per transition (operator chose this over the System-Settings route). Viewer needs no change (execs notify.sh by path). Verified: direct + viewer-path calls return in ms and leave persistent windows; grep confirms no auto-dismiss.

**Added 2026-05-28 (operator: "add a switch to activate/deactivate"):** the workplan-viewer has a runtime on/off switch — a header 🔔/🔕 toggle button + `GET|POST /api/notify-config?enabled=0|1`. The flag is mutable (`notifyEnabled`, honored by `fireNotify`) and persisted to `~/.openclaw/config/workplan-viewer.json`, so it survives viewer restarts (boot value = persisted file, else the MEMORY_PLAN_NOTIFY env default). Verified: get/set/persist + a real restart loads the saved value; disabled → notify-test no-ops (no window).

**Corrected 2026-05-28 (operator: "I want a top-right Notification Center banner, not a modal"):** the `display alert` modal window was WRONG — it's center-screen and focus-grabbing. `memory-plan-notify.sh` now posts a real **top-right NC banner** via **terminal-notifier** (`brew install terminal-notifier`, 2.0.0), with an `osascript display notification` fallback (also top-right). Glass for forward, Sosumi for block. No `display alert` remains.
- **Persistence is a macOS System Setting, not scriptable:** to make banners STAY until dismissed (vs auto-dismiss ~5s), set **System Settings → Notifications → terminal-notifier → "Alerts"** (one-time). Default install style is "Banners" (auto-dismiss).
- **First-run permission:** macOS may require granting terminal-notifier permission to send notifications before banners appear.

**Enriched 2026-05-28 (operator: "can it show the step?"):** the banner message now names the step, not just the version. The viewer looks up the inventory row matching the new version → forward = "step X.Y closed — <desc>" (or "(pre/mid)" while in-flight); block = "blocked at step X.Y — <desc>" (the step it's stuck on). `/api/notify-test?kind=&plan=` renders the real message for a named plan and returns it in JSON; the poller logs it. Verified: forward/block test messages name step 0.1 + its description; a real induced block logged "blocked at step 0.1 — Symlink runtime lib/ → repo lib/".

**Time added 2026-05-28 (operator: "could it show time as well?"):** `memory-plan-notify.sh banner()` appends Montreal-local `HH:MM` to the subtitle (`<version> · HH:MM`), so every banner shows when it fired — applies to all callers (viewer poller, test endpoint, tick) and both the terminal-notifier and osascript paths. Verified: subtitle renders "v0.1 · 14:16".

## 2026-05-27 — Master-plan discipline is intentionally repo-scoped to openclaw-nodedev

**Decision:** The master plan, the scope-check hook, and the SCOPE.md contract govern work done **inside the `openclaw-nodedev` repo only.** They are deliberately NOT propagated to other repos (companion-bridge, mission-control) or to the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Other Claude Code sessions working in other repos are unbound by this discipline.

**Why:** Operator's explicit choice. The discipline exists to fix the development pattern in *this* repo (the memory infrastructure dev work). Extending the hook to every session everywhere would impose friction on unrelated work the operator doesn't want gated.

**Consequences:**
- A session working in `~/Documents/openclaw infrastructure/companion-bridge/` gets neither the CLAUDE.md pointer nor the scope-check hook. That's intended.
- The MASTER_PLAN's stated scope ("everything in ~/.openclaw") refers to what the plan *documents and reasons about* — not what the enforcement mechanism *gates*. The registry tracks all families; the hook only blocks edits made from within this repo.
- **Do not "fix" this by adding the hook to other repos or the global CLAUDE.md.** It is not an oversight. If the operator later wants broader reach, that's a new decision logged here.
