# OpenClaw Memory Plan — Resume Doc

**Workplan status.** Block 0 closed. Block 1 awaits.
**Current version carrier.** `v0.7` (Step 0.7 closed, Block 0 complete).
**Streaks.** zero-Phase-4-correction: 7 of 7 · zero-Phase-8-patch: 7 of 7.
**Last commit on plan branch.** v0.7 — Document state files (docs/STATE_FILES.md).

A fresh worker reading only this file should be able to resume the workplan with no
conversational context. The Framework that governs how steps are executed is at
[FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md). The full implementation plan is at
[REFERENCE_PLAN.md](REFERENCE_PLAN.md). The step list is at [INVENTORY.md](INVENTORY.md).

## §0 — Block-level frozen decisions

These constraints apply to every step in the **current block** (Block 1) and are not
re-litigated per step. Each block transition will reset §0 with the block's own constraints.

### Working principles (apply to all blocks)

- **Local-first.** No phase may break local offline operation. Federation features are opt-in capabilities.
- **One commit per step.** No mid-step commits, no amends, no force-pushes. The Phase 9 commit is the only commit a tick produces.
- **Block on architectural choices.** If a step needs a decision not already captured in §0 or in the prior step's `AUDIT_POST §6` carry-forwards, write `BLOCKED.md` and stop. The autonomous worker does not improvise architecture.
- **Tests are a hard gate.** A red `npm test` at Phase 5 is a block trigger, not a "fix forward" cue.
- **Workspace files are out of repo.** `/Users/moltymac/.openclaw/workspace/` is the live runtime tree (MEMORY.md, .companion-state.md, memory/*). When a step touches a workspace file, the **change is documented in the audit doc** but the workspace file itself is not committed (it's not git-tracked). Plan ledgers committed to the repo describe what landed in the workspace.

### Block 1 frozen decisions

> **IMPORTANT:** Block 1 frozen decisions have NOT yet been authored by the operator.
> The first tick of Block 1 MUST find these decisions populated here before proceeding.
> If this section still contains this placeholder, the tick must write `BLOCKED.md` and stop.

Pending operator decisions for Block 1:
- Scope and file list for Block 1 steps (packages/event-schemas, lib/local-event-log.mjs, lib/artifacts.mjs, JetStream config).
- Whether `pnpm` or `npm` workspaces are used for the schema package.
- Zod version constraint.
- Which memory events to wire first in Step 1.2.

### Carry-forward from Block 0

- **Phase 2 scope must be revisited before Block 2 starts.** A prior repo analysis showed that `lib/mcp-knowledge/core.mjs` already implements sqlite-vec + embeddings via `@huggingface/transformers` (Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2, 384-dim) and is the registered "knowledge" MCP server in `.mcp.json`. Step 2.1's first deliverable is a written re-scoping decision: extend mcp-knowledge to embed session JSONL turns, or add a parallel embedding stack in session-store. Block 2 cannot start without this decision recorded in `RESUME.md §0` for Block 2.
- **Zod is not yet a top-level dependency.** Block 1 adds it via the new `packages/event-schemas` workspace package, not as a root dependency.
- **NATS JetStream is already mesh-wired** ([lib/mesh-tasks.js](../lib/mesh-tasks.js), [lib/mesh-plans.js](../lib/mesh-plans.js), [lib/mesh-collab.js](../lib/mesh-collab.js)). Block 1 adds a NEW stream `local-events-${NODE_ID}` at R=1; existing buckets are untouched.
- **`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** has stale references to `frontend-activity` and `session-fingerprint.json`. Should be updated when convenient.
- **COMPANION variable name** in `daily-log-writer.mjs:34` is cosmetic. Not functionally broken.
- **Test fixture `confidence`** in `test/memory-budget.test.mjs` (lines 284, 315, 388, 389) — harmless extra property.
- **`pre-compact.sh`** is a no-op stub awaiting Block 4 rewiring.
- **`docs/STATE_FILES.md`** should be updated as Block 1 adds new state files.

## §1 — Per-step close paragraphs

### Step 0.1 — Wire MemoryBudget.reload() into daemon flush paths + NATS subscription + test

Closed at v0.1. `MemoryBudget.reload()` now fires after both daemon flush paths
(pre-compression at line 835, end-of-session at line 874) and via an optional NATS
subscription on `mesh.memory.compaction_completed` (line 1054). The NATS connection is
optional with graceful degradation — if NATS is unavailable, the daemon continues to work
locally. One new test added. 6 positive audit findings, zero Phase 4 corrections, zero
Phase 8 patches. Carry-forwards to Step 0.2: the daemon now has an async shutdown handler
and an optional `natsConn` in `main()` scope.

### Step 0.2 — Resolve .companion-state.md collision (rename to .daemon-state-${NODE_ID}.md + migrate readers)

Closed at v0.2. Daemon state file renamed from `.companion-state.md` to
`.daemon-state-${NODE_ID}.md` across all four readers: `memory-daemon.mjs` (line 526),
`session-start.sh` (line 33), `daily-log-writer.mjs` (line 34), and
`mission-control/src/app/api/tasks/route.ts` (line 23). Function `readCompanionState`
renamed to `readDaemonState`. Migration script `scripts/migrate-companion-state.mjs`
added — idempotent, detects daemon-written files via `## Session Status` / `last_flush`
markers. `NODE_ID` derived consistently as `process.env.OPENCLAW_NODE_ID || os.hostname()`
across all JS/TS files and `${OPENCLAW_NODE_ID:-$(hostname)}` in shell. 6 positive audit
findings, zero Phase 4 corrections, zero Phase 8 patches. Carry-forwards to Step 0.3:
`COMPANION` variable name retained in daily-log-writer (cosmetic, deferred); session-start.sh
sandbox restriction requires operator pre-apply for Step 0.6; test baseline unchanged at 467.

### Step 0.3 — Fix mergeFacts parenthetical chain (supersedes-event-id comment model + one-time cleanup)

Closed at v0.3. Replaced the parenthetical merge format `(updated: ...)` in `mergeFacts`
with a supersedes-comment model: merged entries now write the NEW fact verbatim plus an
invisible `<!-- supersedes: <8-char-sha256> -->` HTML comment. Added
`cleanParentheticalChains(content)` to strip legacy chains (keeps only the innermost/most
recent segment). Added `stripSupersedes(text)` for clean similarity comparison. 5 new
regression tests cover 10-merge accumulation, nested chain cleanup, supersedes presence,
comment stripping, and no-chain passthrough. `crypto` import added (Node.js built-in, no
new dependency). 6 positive audit findings, zero Phase 4 corrections, zero Phase 8 patches.
Carry-forwards to Step 0.4: test baseline now 472 (399 pass, 73 fail pre-existing);
`extractFacts` still filters `role === 'user'` only; `confidence` field still unused;
`crypto` import shifts line numbers in `pre-compression-flush.mjs`.

### Step 0.4 — Include assistant-role messages in extraction + add speaker field + new patterns

Closed at v0.4. Opened `extractFacts` role filter to include assistant messages
alongside user messages (line 166). Added `stripSpeaker(text)` helper (line 203) to
remove `[user]`/`[assistant]` prefix before similarity comparison. Added two
assistant-voice pattern groups: `agent_action` (line 160) for intent declarations
(`I'll`, `I'm going to`, etc.) and `finding` (line 162) for observations (`I found`,
`I noticed`, etc.). Added `speaker: msg.role` field on all extracted fact objects
(line 180). Updated `mergeFacts` to format entries with `[speaker]` prefix and strip
speaker tags during similarity comparison and hash computation. 5 new tests cover
assistant inclusion, speaker field, pattern matching, tool exclusion, and speaker tag
formatting. 6 positive audit findings, zero Phase 4 corrections, zero Phase 8 patches.
Carry-forwards to Step 0.5: test baseline now 477 (404 pass, 73 fail pre-existing);
`confidence` field still unused (deferred to Step 0.6); `stripSpeaker` exported at
line 203; speaker tags formatted as `[user]`/`[assistant]` in MEMORY.md entries;
`agent_action` and `finding` categories are new (no downstream consumer filters by
category yet).

### Step 0.5 — Fix mid-word truncation via truncateAtWord helper

Closed at v0.5. Added `truncateAtWord(text, maxLen)` helper at
`lib/pre-compression-flush.mjs:212` to replace the hard `.slice(0, 120)` in
`extractFacts` (line 173). The helper truncates at the last space before `maxLen`,
with a 0.7 fallback threshold that avoids absurdly short results when a single word
is very long (falls back to hard slice if `lastSpace < maxLen * 0.7`). 4 new tests
cover short-text passthrough, word-boundary truncation, long-word fallback, and
exact-length passthrough. 6 positive audit findings, zero Phase 4 corrections, zero
Phase 8 patches. Carry-forwards to Step 0.6: test baseline now 481 (408 pass, 73
fail pre-existing); `confidence` field still unused (Step 0.6 deletes it);
`truncateAtWord` exported at line 212; `cleanParentheticalChains` shifted to line 222.

### Step 0.6 — Delete dead artifacts (.pre-compact-state.md write, .tmp/session-fingerprint.json, .tmp/frontend-activity, confidence field)

Closed at v0.6. Removed four dead artifacts that were written but never read by any
in-repo consumer. (1) `.claude/hooks/pre-compact.sh`: removed `STATE_FILE` variable and
the entire `.pre-compact-state.md` write block; hook retained as no-op stub for future
Block 4 rewiring. (2) `workspace-bin/session-recap`: deleted `FINGERPRINT_FILE` constant,
`extractFingerprint` function (~60 lines), `writeFingerprint` function (~12 lines), and
the fingerprint caller block in `main()`. (3) `workspace-bin/auto-checkpoint`: deleted
`ACTIVITY_FILE` variable and `touch "$ACTIVITY_FILE"`. (4) `lib/pre-compression-flush.mjs`:
removed `confidence` property from all 7 pattern objects, from the loop destructuring, from
the fact push, and from both JSDoc annotations. `extractFacts` return shape is now
`{ fact, category, speaker }`. 1 new regression test asserts `confidence` is absent from
returned fact objects. 6 positive audit findings, zero Phase 4 corrections, zero Phase 8
patches. Carry-forwards to Step 0.7: test baseline now 482 (409 pass, 73 fail pre-existing);
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` has stale references to `frontend-activity` and
`session-fingerprint.json` (out of Block 0 scope, defer or address if Step 0.7's
`docs/STATE_FILES.md` work opens the door); `pre-compact.sh` is a no-op stub; test
fixture data still passes `confidence` in some `mergeFacts` calls (harmless, cosmetic).

### Step 0.7 — Document state files (docs/STATE_FILES.md)

Closed at v0.7. Created `docs/STATE_FILES.md` — comprehensive reference inventory of
every runtime state file the memory infrastructure writes. Organized by location:
workspace runtime files (`~/.openclaw/workspace/`), daemon internal state (`.tmp/`),
SQLite databases (`~/.openclaw/`), and configuration files (`~/.openclaw/config/`).
Each entry documents owner process, format, lifetime, and consumers. Includes a
"Files removed in Block 0" section tracking the four artifacts deleted in Step 0.6.
Documentation-only step: zero functional code changes, zero new tests. 6 positive
audit findings, zero Phase 4 corrections, zero Phase 8 patches. **Block 0 complete
(7/7).**

## Next-tick checklist

The next scheduled tick should:

1. Run pre-flight (Framework §8).
2. Decode state: `VERSION` is `v0.7` (no suffix) → Start NEXT step at Phase 1.
3. Read `INVENTORY.md` → first `[ ]` row is Step 1.1.
4. **BLOCK TRANSITION**: Block 0 is closed. Block 1 §0 frozen decisions must be populated by the operator before the first Block 1 tick can proceed. If §0 still contains the placeholder, write `BLOCKED.md` and stop.
5. Read `AUDIT_POST §6` from `memory-plan/audits/step07_document_state_files/AUDIT_POST.md` and `memory-plan/audits/BLOCK_0_COMPLETE.md` for carry-forwards.
6. Execute Phases 1 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 8.5 → 9 for Step 1.1.
7. Commit. Stop.
