# Node state recovery — decisions

## D1 — Independent preservation (2026-09-28 07:36 EDT)
The operator authorized complete review/repairs with Claude as adversarial collaborator. Viewer 1.6 remains open for production browser acceptance. This supporting silo permits independent preservation while keeping that unfinished outcome explicit. It feeds node-readiness 1.3; no automatic chain is enabled.

## D2 — SQLite snapshots and isolated restoration (2026-09-28 07:36 EDT)
Pin read-only source transactions and use SQLite's backup API, never a raw live DB/WAL copy. Load installed sqlite-vec directly, avoiding application initialization that can migrate/rotate/vacuum state. Compare integrity, schema, user_version, counts and typed content hashes. Keep transcript contents private; publish sanitized acceptance. Private permissions apply before creation.

## D3 — Both bus histories (2026-09-28 07:36 EDT)
Standalone and cluster names overlap but histories differ. Online snapshots miss offline R=1 collaboration/plan data on member 1. Preserve all four physical stores while servers are stopped, then verify on independently routed loopback instances. No union, requeue, deletion or topology change during preservation.

## D4 — Individual snapshots do not prove coordinated recovery (2026-09-28)
Claude identified the coupling between SQLite cursors and JetStream durable acknowledgements. Step 1.1 proves recoverability per store; 1.2 proves the bus histories. New step 1.3 takes their final coordinated set under verified writer quiescence before parent topology repair. Each individual snapshot records its own time window; no globally consistent point is inferred from sequential live copies. Native virtual-table checks run only on declared isolated restores. Source connections load no extension. Self-vector queries accept distance-zero duplicates, since tied results need not choose the probe's identity first.

## D5 — Complete application recovery includes file sources (2026-09-28 08:45 EDT)
Claude accepted child 1.1's SQLite outcome. It does not cover raw session JSONL,
gateway memory-source files, the vault, tokens/configs, notification ledger,
foreman timelines or browser profiles. Step 1.3 must label every store as primary
or derived and include or explicitly exclude these source families in the common
quiet window. Browser vendor state remains excluded from 1.1 only; its coordinated
recovery policy is not silently inherited. ENOENT caused by atomic file churn
currently refuses scans safely; handle it without weakening missing/unknown-store
refusal before the coordinated run. On-disk copies are logical rollback points,
not proof against machine or disk loss.

## D6 — Preserve split bus histories before repair (2026-09-28 08:58 EDT)
Claude Message 70 challenged the sequence. Step 1.2's Needs now requires intact
offline directories, not its own future preservation output. Installed live
units all run the same NATS 2.12.6 binary; the observed member-1 failure is the
monitor bind on 8222, before JetStream recovery. Reconfirm immediately before
operations. After owned fixtures pass, boot out this failing unit and copy its
unopened store first. Keep the non-serving member under a documented preservation
hold until topology 1.4, instead of restarting its failure loop. This reversible
service hold is within the operator's authorized repairs; no stream is deleted
or merged. For the remaining cold copies, drain all clients/timers, stop members
2/3 before standalone, and resume standalone first. Clone routes use fresh
loopback ports, explicit route credentials and no_advertise. Masters are never
server-opened. Replica/TTL overrides affect only isolated recovery, are recorded,
and never become production configuration. File-source coordinated recovery
remains child 1.3; per-stream snapshots are not a common recovery point.
