# Node state recovery — decisions

## D1 — Independent preservation (2026-09-28 07:36 EDT)
The operator authorized complete review/repairs with Claude as adversarial collaborator. Viewer 1.6 remains open for production browser acceptance. This supporting silo permits independent preservation while keeping that unfinished outcome explicit. It feeds node-readiness 1.3; no automatic chain is enabled.

## D2 — SQLite snapshots and isolated restoration (2026-09-28 07:36 EDT)
Pin read-only source transactions and use SQLite's backup API, never a raw live DB/WAL copy. Load installed sqlite-vec directly, avoiding application initialization that can migrate/rotate/vacuum state. Compare integrity, schema, user_version, counts and typed content hashes. Keep transcript contents private; publish sanitized acceptance. Private permissions apply before creation.

## D3 — Both bus histories (2026-09-28 07:36 EDT)
Standalone and cluster names overlap but histories differ. Online snapshots miss offline R=1 collaboration/plan data on member 1. Preserve all four physical stores while servers are stopped, then verify on independently routed loopback instances. No union, requeue, deletion or topology change during preservation.

## D4 — Individual snapshots do not prove coordinated recovery (2026-09-28)
Claude identified the coupling between SQLite cursors and JetStream durable acknowledgements. Step 1.1 proves recoverability per store; 1.2 proves the bus histories. New step 1.3 takes their final coordinated set under verified writer quiescence before parent topology repair. Each individual snapshot records its own time window; no globally consistent point is inferred from sequential live copies. Native virtual-table checks run only on declared isolated restores. Source connections load no extension. Self-vector queries accept distance-zero duplicates, since tied results need not choose the probe's identity first.

## D5 — Complete application recovery includes file sources (2026-09-28 08:45 EDT)
Claude accepted child 1.1's SQLite outcome. It does not cover raw session JSONL,
gateway memory-source files, the vault, tokens/configs, notification ledger,
foreman timelines or browser profiles. Step 1.3 must label every store as primary
or derived and include or explicitly exclude these source families in the common
quiet window. Browser vendor state remains excluded from 1.1 only; its coordinated
recovery policy is not silently inherited. ENOENT caused by atomic file churn
currently refuses scans safely; handle it without weakening missing/unknown-store
refusal before the coordinated run. On-disk copies are logical rollback points,
not proof against machine or disk loss.

## D6 — Preserve split bus histories before repair (2026-09-28 08:58 EDT)
Claude Message 70 challenged the sequence. Step 1.2's Needs now requires intact
offline directories, not its own future preservation output. Installed live
units all run the same NATS 2.12.6 binary; the observed member-1 failure is the
monitor bind on 8222, before JetStream recovery. Reconfirm immediately before
operations. After owned fixtures pass, boot out this failing unit and copy its
unopened store first. Persist the non-serving member
hold with `launchctl disable gui/$UID/ai.openclaw.nats-1` and verify it using
`print-disabled`; bootout alone would reload at login and race with standalone.
Keep it disabled until topology 1.4, instead of restarting its failure loop. This reversible
service hold is within the operator's authorized repairs; no stream is deleted
or merged. For the remaining cold copies, drain all clients/timers, stop members
2/3 before standalone, and resume standalone first. Clone routes use fresh
loopback ports, explicit route credentials and no_advertise. Masters are never
server-opened. Replica/TTL overrides affect only isolated recovery, are recorded,
and never become production configuration. File-source coordinated recovery
remains child 1.3; per-stream snapshots are not a common recovery point.

D6 review correction (2026-09-28 09:32 EDT): Claude Message 74 independently
confirmed that deleting an offline stream assignment through survivors causes
its owner to erase the R1 working history on rejoin. Never delete the offline
COLLAB/PLANS assignments. The hold is reversible with enable only after topology
1.4 has independently verified preservation and uncontested listeners.

## D7 — Admission-fenced, reboot-resumable preservation (2026-09-28 21:33 EDT)
Claude demonstrated that sampled zero clients misses millisecond writers and
failed logins. Replace the old managed-window script; do not weaken it into
acceptance. Bind each server by ID/start/config digest and physical listeners.
After named observer closure use HTTP only, cumulative admissions, open/closed
CIDs, JetStream API counters, stream policy/state and durable positions through
every stop. Producer-first stops and actual owner/descendant/queue evidence are
required. A private fsynced journal records intent before each mutation and
retains incomplete copies without an acceptance manifest. Preserve persistent
service holds across a reboot and restore their original loaded/running/disabled
state only after truthful readiness checks; member 1 remains held under D6.
A reboot invalidates the quiet window, not permission to restore the prior node.
Crash recovery and independent older stream snapshots are not a common point.
Worker reboot policy and the unready deploy listener feed parent readiness 1.5
and 2.2; they are not silently repaired or called ready in this preservation step.

## D8 — Reboot restoration and deploy-listener ordering (2026-09-28 22:16 EDT)
Claude's35e56ff review refines D7: normal serving/client units use temporary
bootout-only holds. Member1 remains the sole persistent disable. A reboot can
then restore ordinary jobs; it invalidates the copy window and any partial
master, which must never receive acceptance. Durable recovery first observes
each affected unit and records already-restored owners without restarting them.
Only a known mismatched state permits an idempotent restoration; unverified
readiness refuses. The final check requires physical4222/8222 ownership and
the member1 disabled/unloaded hold. The deploy listener resumes last after
current deploy-marker/HEAD checks, because it can restart other owners. Timers
loaded with RunAtLoad must finish their initial run successfully before the
ready callback compares their originally idle state. These remain operational
gates, not proof supplied by a journal or generic callback alone.
