# Node state recovery — registry

## Family 1: persisted application state

### SQLite application stores
| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | ACCEPTED: twelve per-store snapshots restore correctly; independent review accepted e750e3e; coordinated recovery remains 1.3 |
| **Verified** | 2026-09-28 08:31 EDT: 852,017,152 snapshot bytes, 116 physical tables, matching typed content/rowids/header/FK fingerprints, core integrity; six native FTS checks and eight vector probes pass. Owner-private files; running service PIDs/runs unchanged. Node 24 daemon/knowledge SQLite 3.49.2; Node 22 MC SQLite 3.53.2; gateway node:sqlite 3.50.4/vec 0.1.9. Agent stores have compatibility probes, not owner-engine claims. Header inventory refuses unknown stores/links; explicit browser/historical/source exclusions. |

### JetStream histories
| | |
|---|---|
| **Status** | SPLIT, preservation in flight: standalone 4222 and cluster 4223/4224 serve; failed member 1 persistently held; three healthy cold masters pending |
| **Verified** | 2026-09-28 21:33 EDT: member-1 protected master and its isolated R1 restoration accepted; eleven individual online archives restored with 80,156 non-expiring messages. After the VM crash, nine reachable non-expiring stream states/configs and durable positions match the older archive points; no immediate pre-crash acknowledgement guarantee. Worker explicitly restored under a 65-second idle guard. All three serving bus identities/routes remain unchanged through revised owned recovery tests; member 2 is metadata leader. Fifteen preservation checks, a real account-group election regression, fifty-three journal fault tests and complete owned recovery fixtures pass. Journal is a primitive; managed orchestration remains pending. New managed-window acceptance, three healthy cold copies and coordinated recovery remain open. |

Current mechanism checkpoint 2026-09-28 23:49 EDT: tools-v30 passes53 fresh journal tests; unchanged15 admission/1 election tests inherit identical source hashes. Creation prepares the receipt before mkdir; interrupted setup is restoration-only. bbbc883 CI36516935187 is green, while this newer patch awaits exact CI/review. No new healthy production stop or cold-copy acceptance.

Current mechanism checkpoint 2026-09-29 00:58 EDT: tools-v31 passes55 fresh
journal tests, including initializing-root Finder recovery and fenced invalid
metadata. The unpatched ab7097c control fails as expected. Its exact CI
36518928261 is green and Claude accepted the previous creation fixes; this
new checkpoint requires fresh integration CI/review. PR149 merged55131b8;
installed task-daemon PID82096/runs1 still uses the accepted readiness release.
No production preservation window or healthy cold-copy acceptance exists.

Managed-stop checkpoint 2026-09-29 01:11 EDT: tools-v33 passes six actual owned
macOS launchd/authenticated-NATS controls; crash/surviving-child/timer-race/wrong
argv negatives refuse. Eleven current healthy owners pass read-only binding.
No healthy production stop or preservation window. N3 exact CI36523987643
green3/3 and Claude Message38 accepts it. Adapter exact CI/review pending;
detached orchestrator/static inventory/restoration/cold masters remain open.

Fixture-readiness checkpoint 2026-09-29 01:21 EDT: f3bb44f CI failed before Mac test
collection in old stream placement. Full owned readiness/missing-peer control
and existing recovery checks pass from tools-v36; two refused drafts retained
with normal cleanup. New exact CI/review pending. Production source and service
owners remain unchanged; healthy cold masters and the driver are still open.

Managed-controls checkpoint 2026-09-29 01:44 EDT: private tools-v40 passes13
actual Mac controls/1 explicit cross-domain skip, tools-v39 passes recovery
with actual peer/route negatives. Thirteen owners have read-only entry/code/
environment bindings; Discord has no current root PID and deploy listener
remains unready. Timer idle/log observations alone refuse complete unload
verification. New exact CI/review pending; no production quiet window or
healthy cold-copy acceptance. See D15 and MANAGED_CONTROL_REVIEW.json.
